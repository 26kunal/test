Location anda facilities
There was also  garbage in our kitchen - there were isntant coffee packages left from previous customers.
Amazing facilities.
"Only one elevator ,"
Room was very spacious
The bathroom is dirty.
Roof terrace great
No tea or coffee making facilities in the rooms
the room had aircon and we had earplugs and slept soundly.
"Also, when the bright bathroom lights are turned on, it lights up the whole hotel room, shining thru the frosted glass panels."
The Bed was SUPER COMFY !
"Bathroom was extra small,"
Rooms are cosy with great temperature control.
Facilities were very clean.
only if you don't mind stains in your bed sheets or cockroaches in your (shared) bathroom.
The bathroom functioned o.k.
Poor TV picture and channel selection.
No elevator.
essential gym to allow for some workout.
"Rooms quite small for price, especially if you use a travel cot."
room was not at all inviting.
Wifi connected
Everything was very clean.
Windows haven't been cleaned for years (if ever).
"Showers could do with some renovations - they seem clean,"
Only cold water came out.
the Persian decor is so half-hearted it - I'd take down the 5 lengths of Turkish bunting lanterns above the glass roofed bar or cover the whole area with them - 30 more (!)
The toilet ran until you jiggled the handle.
The bed was terrible and not comfortable at all
Dimly lit.
The towels had holes in them.
The hotel  advertised AC as one of its amenities in its booking.com descriptions!
The bed was super comfortable and the bathtub with jets was awesome too.
We actually enjoyed how small our room was because we knew about it ahead of time and wanted to try something really different.
"Bedding was changed once,"
"The same counts for the bathroom, especially the shower was great."
The hotel has a rooftop with a hot tub which has an awesome view.
It was quiet.
"Rooms are small,"
The drapes could have fit the window.
It was very not comfortable.
Facilities were great.
Just one bed so in your room you always have to sit on the bed.
So there could have been more convenient outlets.
The exercise room closest to my floor was filled with big screen TVs and sheets covering them.
a bit tight to make people either pay or leave yr room.
Shower was intense.
"The bed was very comfortable, and room minimalist"
Rooms aren't very sound proof from hallway sounds.
Cool design.
"Our room was very spacious, especially for NYC."
The main lobby is nice
Carpets are coming unstitched.
It was bigger so that was nice!
Room was not cleaned even once during our stay.
Room not what we ordered or prepaid for.
"The room needed to be painted,"
"Sep 5-8 room 302
Room was too small, the shower pressure was good."
"Very large for Manhattan with good sized bed, flat screen TV & ample closet."
#NAME?
Waited over 40 minutes to use shower.
The lifts worked!
Elevators tend to be slow...
Crumbs from snacks were not cleaned up for 3 days!!
the bathroom was a little dirty with hair at the walls
"We had requested two queen beds and got a room with 1 queen and 2 twins, we were advised that there were not any other rooms and could put the (2) beds together, which we did and it was no issue as far as sleeping."
Noisy noisy suite on 4th floor.
no way to lock the door.
Location location location!!!
Rip off!
Informed that would have a view of Times Square and did not and that was why paying such a lot for the New Years eve had arrange to pay Â£60 dollars extra for view of ball drop
Reasonably priced Italian restaurant off the paneled lobby.
"Great feel to this hotel, excellent location away from the tourist rush of NYC"
Continental breakfast quality was poor.
Right across the street from the very relaxing and IMHO the best park in the city Bryant Park.
the elevator men were really cool.
The hotel is central
The location of the apartments was what attracted us and the amazing value for money.
No room service.
Wifi connection was not good.
The location is amazing - right in the heart of the Flatiron District.
Also just down from Madison Square Park.
The location was great.
"Good placed in the city, very close to Times Square and Rockfeller center, good restorants and bars close to it."
Cafeteria was great and they make good food

"Location to parking garage, train stop, restaurants"
Convenient location close to subway.
"The location is wonderful, just two blocks from Central Park."
"The location, it's near a few of our favorite craft beer bars."
"They charged money (5$) just to keep your luggage at the end of the stay, unbelievable."
While the streets are rather busy during the day the area gets quiet at night.
Very close to Times Square
Within walking distance to Columbia University.
